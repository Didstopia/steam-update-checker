# Todo-list

Things that still need doing.

### Doing Now

- [ ] Implement a basic Go app structure
- [ ] Target all supported platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- [ ] Implement basic update checking
- [ ] Add support for parameters, so app id, branch etc.

### Doing Later

- [ ] Add support for CI (Travis?)
- [ ] Automatically release builds (GitHub Releases for production builds, something else for test builds, S3 perhaps?)
- [ ] Add support for authentication
- [ ]Â Add support for Steam Guard (2FA)
- [ ] Figure out how to do this _without_ relying on steamcmd or alternatively integrate steamcmd with the app itself
